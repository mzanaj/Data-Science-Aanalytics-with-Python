# Data-Science-Aanalytics-with-Python

This was my first course in Python programming. It was quite an intense introduction, that ultimately benefitted my overall knowledge in successive courses. The course was mainly divided into two parts. The first half of the course consisted of an accelerated introduction to the Python programming language, including brief introductions to object-oriented and functional programming styles as well as tools for code optimization. The second half of the course surveyed tools for handling structured data (regular expressions, HTML/JSON, databases), data visualization, numerical and symbolic computing, and large-scale distributed computing.

One of the books used for this course was Python for Everybody by Charles Severance's( https://www.py4e.com/book.php#python-for-informatics. This books was quite intuitive and easy to understand for anyone new to Python. Would suggest as a resource.
